## Task 2 - Installation

[Installation](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/GettingStarted.htm)

## Task 3 - Quiz

These first questions shouldn't be too hard. Just look at the navigation bar (Folders and Resources).

![#1, 2, 3 and 4](/thm/images/nessus/newscan1.png)

For the next 4 questions, take a look at the types of scans.

## Task 4 - Scanning

For the next questions we'll make use of the "Basic Network Scan". There's an option to schedule the scan to a specific time but for now that's not needed.

In the discovery tab we can choose between scanning just common ports or all ports. Select: "Port scan (all ports).

In the advanced settings, we should select the option: "Scan low bandwidth links".

After having set all the correct settings, we can launch the scan (this will probably take a few minutes). In the results we can look through the vulnerabilities found on the server.
